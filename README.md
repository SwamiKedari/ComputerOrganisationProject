# ComputerOrganisationProject
We used java programming language for our project . 
The Project consists of 3 java classes :
# 1) simulator :
  This is the class from which the project is run . The text file to be simulated is passed inside the main method of this class .
  It has all code needed to run the project programs successfully .
  
 # 2) Register :
  The Register class has data structures that depict the registers and memory . 
  It also has methods used to understand the instructions , register names of the program .
  This class evaluates this instructions and display the registers and the memory in the terminal . 
  There are 32 registers in this project as in RISC V .
  The Register class also has code to print the registers and memory elements in the terminal . 
  
 # 3) parser :
  This class mainly takes the file and stores the instructions .
  It also removes the comments and blank lines in the program .
  This project only support single line comments .
  
  As of now , we have not worked on multiline comments , taking user Input in the program , and storing strings in the memory .
